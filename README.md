# Ekit fork
This is a fork of [Ekit](https://github.com/hexidec/Ekit) - The original Open Source Java-based HTML Editor. 

This fork just moves files a little and adds pom.xml so that library can be released. 

I use this in one of my pre-historic projects and this is the easiest way, without reafctoring original project. It will be 
released under my company package.

NOTE: I had to make some changes to code (most;y comments because german language in source files is not supported.
